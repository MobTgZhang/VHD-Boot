# Vloop
The project mainly use a method to boot linux from fixed-size VHD file.You should set a fixed VHD file.When booting into Linux system,the root directory of the system is labeled as `/dev/mapper/loop0$VLOOPPART`.But now I still play a linux system like fedora on a lvm partition,but this project will be updated in the future to solve this problem.
